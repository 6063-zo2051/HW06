# HOMEWORK 06 

The goal of this assignment was to draw with words. I chose to represent the lyrics to the intro of "Dark Fantasy" by Kanye West featuring Nicki Minaj. I decided to use push and pop, as well as rotate calls to map out the lyrics to spell YE, Kanye West's stage name. I did this by mapping the lyric lines one by one. I struggled a bit with getting the cordinates for x and y  to be accurate as I may have rotated my entire window on accident, but I was able to map it out eventually.
